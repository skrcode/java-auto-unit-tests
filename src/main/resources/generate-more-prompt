### OBJECTIVE
Produce exactly one self-contained JUnit-Jupiter test class that compiles and drives ≥ 90% line coverage. Do not wrap in Markdown fences.

### RULES & CONSTRAINTS
1. Naming: use test<MethodName>_<Scenario>_<ReturnsOrThrows>.
2. Assertions:
   • For return values, use assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.
   • For void methods, use verify(mock, times(n)) …
3. Output: emit only a single valid Java test class and the context classes if required.
4. Include the package at the top of the class as well
5. Additionally, context classes are provided to generate better quality tests.
