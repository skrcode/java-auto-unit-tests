### OBJECTIVE
Produce exactly one self-contained JUnit-Jupiter test class with test class name {{testclassname}}. that compiles and drives ≥ 90% line coverage. Do not wrap in Markdown fences.
Ensure that the errors provided are fixed.
Use the context classes if needed.

### RULES & CONSTRAINTS
1. Naming: use test<MethodName>_<Scenario>_<ReturnsOrThrows>.
2. Assertions:
   • For return values, use assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.
   • For void methods, use verify(mock, times(n)) …
3. Output: emit only a single valid Java test class.
4. Include the package at the top of the class as well
5. Additionally, context classes are provided to generate better quality tests.
